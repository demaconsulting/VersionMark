# ReviewMark Usage Standard

## Required Standards

Read these standards first before applying this standard:

- **`software-items.md`** - Software categorization (System/Subsystem/Unit/OTS)

## Purpose

ReviewMark manages file review status enforcement and formal review processes. It tracks which files need
review, organizes them into review-sets, and generates review plans and reports.

## Key Commands

- **Lint Configuration**: `dotnet reviewmark --lint`
- **Elaborate Review-Set**: `dotnet reviewmark --elaborate {review-set}`
- **Generate Plan**: `dotnet reviewmark --plan docs/code_review_plan/generated/plan.md --enforce`

> **Note**: `--enforce` causes the plan to fail with a non-zero exit code if any repository
> files are not covered by a review-set. Uncovered files indicate a gap in review-set
> configuration that should be addressed.

## Repository Structure

Required repository items for ReviewMark operation:

- `.reviewmark.yaml` - Configuration for review-sets, file-patterns, and review evidence-source.
- `docs/code_review_plan/generated/` - Generated review plan (build output, do not edit)
- `docs/code_review_report/generated/` - Generated review report (build output, do not edit)

# Review Definition Structure

Configure reviews in `.reviewmark.yaml` at repository root:

```yaml
# Patterns identifying all files that require review
needs-review:
  # Include source code (adjust file extensions for your repo)
  - "**/*.cs"           # C# source files
  - "**/*.cpp"          # C++ source files
  - "**/*.hpp"          # C++ header files
  - "!**/bin/**"        # Generated source in build outputs
  - "!**/obj/**"        # Generated source in build intermediates

  # Include requirement files
  - "requirements.yaml"        # Root requirements file
  - "docs/reqstream/**/*.yaml" # Requirements files

  # Include critical documentation files
  - "README.md"                                 # Root level README
  - "docs/user_guide/**/*.md"                   # User guide
  - "docs/design/**/*.md"                       # Design documentation
  - "docs/verification/**/*.md"                 # Verification design documentation

# Source of review evidence
evidence-source:
  type: none

# Review-sets (each focuses on a single compliance question)
reviews:
  - id: Purpose
    title: Review of user-facing capabilities and system promises
    paths:
      - "README.md"
      - "docs/user_guide/**/*.md"
      - "docs/reqstream/{system-name}.yaml"
      - "docs/design/introduction.md"
      - "docs/design/{system-name}.md"
```

# Review-Set Design Principles

When constructing review-sets, follow these principles to maintain manageable scope and effective compliance evidence:

- **Hierarchical Scope**: Higher-level reviews exclude lower-level implementation details, relying instead on design
  documents to describe what components they use. System reviews exclude subsystem/unit details, subsystem reviews
  exclude unit source code, only unit reviews include actual implementation.
- **Single Focus**: Each review-set proves one specific compliance question (user promises, system architecture,
  design consistency, etc.)
- **Context Management**: Keep file counts manageable to prevent context overflow while maintaining complete coverage
  through the hierarchy

# Review-Set Organization

Organize review-sets using these standard patterns to ensure comprehensive coverage
while keeping each review manageable in scope:

**Naming conventions**: See `software-items.md` - kebab-case placeholders
(e.g., `{system-name}`) are always kebab-case; cased placeholders
(e.g., `{SystemName}`) follow your language's convention.

## `Purpose` Review (only one per repository)

Reviews user-facing capabilities and system promises:

- **Purpose**: Proves that the systems provide the capabilities the user is being told about
- **Title**: "Review that Advertised Features Match System Design"
- **Scope**: Excludes subsystem and unit files, relying on system-level design documents
  to describe what subsystems and units they use
- **File Path Patterns**:
  - README: `README.md`
  - User guide: `docs/user_guide/**/*.md`
  - System requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system-name}.yaml`
  - Design introduction: `docs/design/introduction.md`
  - System design: `docs/design/{system-name}.md`

## `{System}-Architecture` Review (one per system)

Reviews system architecture and operational validation:

- **Purpose**: Proves that the system is designed and tested to satisfy its requirements
- **Title**: "Review that {System} Architecture Satisfies Requirements"
- **Scope**: Excludes subsystem and unit files, relying on system-level design to describe
  what subsystems and units it uses
- **File Path Patterns**:
  - System requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system-name}.yaml`
  - Design introduction: `docs/design/introduction.md`
  - System design: `docs/design/{system-name}.md`
  - Verification introduction: `docs/verification/introduction.md`
  - System verification design: `docs/verification/{system-name}.md`
  - System integration tests: `test/{SystemName}.Tests/{SystemName}Tests.{ext}`

## `{System}-Design` Review (one per system)

Reviews architectural and design consistency:

- **Purpose**: Proves the system design is consistent and complete
- **Title**: "Review that {System} Design is Consistent and Complete"
- **Scope**: Only brings in top-level requirements and relies on brevity of design documentation
- **File Path Patterns**:
  - System requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system-name}.yaml`
  - Platform requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system-name}/platform-requirements.yaml`
  - Design introduction: `docs/design/introduction.md`
  - System design: `docs/design/{system-name}.md`
  - System design files: `docs/design/{system-name}/**/*.md`

## `{System}-AllRequirements` Review (one per system)

Reviews requirements quality and traceability:

- **Purpose**: Proves the requirements are consistent and complete
- **Title**: "Review that All {System} Requirements are Complete"
- **Scope**: Only brings in requirements files to keep review manageable
- **File Path Patterns**:
  - Root requirements: `requirements.yaml`
  - System requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system-name}.yaml`
  - Subsystem/unit requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system-name}/**/*.yaml`

## `{System}-{Subsystem[-Child...]}` Review (one per subsystem at any depth)

Reviews subsystem architecture and interfaces:

- **Purpose**: Proves that the subsystem is designed and tested to satisfy its requirements
- **Title**: "Review that {System} {Subsystem} Satisfies Subsystem Requirements"
- **Scope**: Excludes units under the subsystem, relying on subsystem design to describe
  what units it uses
- **File Path Patterns**:
  - Requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system-name}/.../{subsystem-name}.yaml`
  - Design: `docs/design/{system-name}/.../{subsystem-name}.md`
  - Verification design: `docs/verification/{system-name}/.../{subsystem-name}.md`
  - Tests: `test/{SystemName}.Tests/.../{SubsystemName}/{SubsystemName}Tests.{ext}`

## `{System}-{Subsystem[-Child...]}-{Unit}` Review (one per unit)

Reviews individual software unit implementation:

- **Purpose**: Proves the unit is designed, implemented, and tested to satisfy its requirements
- **Title**: "Review that {System} {Subsystem} {Unit} Implementation is Correct"
- **Scope**: Complete unit review including all artifacts
- **File Path Patterns**:
  - Requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system-name}/.../{unit-name}.yaml`
  - Design: `docs/design/{system-name}/.../{unit-name}.md`
  - Verification design: `docs/verification/{system-name}/.../{unit-name}.md`
  - Source: `src/{SystemName}/.../{UnitName}.{ext}`
  - Tests: `test/{SystemName}.Tests/.../{UnitName}Tests.{ext}`

## `OTS-{OtsName}` Review (one per OTS item)

Reviews OTS item requirements and verification evidence:

- **Purpose**: Proves that the OTS item provides the required functionality
- **Title**: "Review that {OtsName} Provides Required Functionality"
- **Scope**: OTS items have no in-house design or source; review covers requirements and
  verification evidence only
- **File Path Patterns**:
  - OTS requirements: `docs/reqstream/ots/{ots-name}.yaml`
  - OTS verification: `docs/verification/ots/{ots-name}.md`
  - Tests (if applicable): `test/{OtsSoftwareTests}/...` (cased per language)

**Note**: File path patterns use `{ext}` as a placeholder for language-specific
extensions (`.cs`, `.cpp`/`.hpp`, `.py`, etc.). Adapt to your repository's languages.

# Quality Checks
