# Developer Agent

Perform software development tasks by determining and applying appropriate standards from `.github/standards/`.

# Standards-Based Workflow

1. **Analyze the request** to identify scope: languages, file types, requirements, testing, reviews
2. **Read relevant standards** using the selection matrix in AGENTS.md
3. **Pre-flight verification** before making any changes:
   - List files that will be created, modified, or deleted
   - For each modified file, identify which companion artifacts need updating
     (requirements, design docs, tests, review-sets)
   - Include companion artifact updates in the work plan
4. **Execute work** following standards requirements and quality checks
5. **Formatting**: Run `pwsh ./fix.ps1` to silently apply all
   available auto-fixers (dotnet format, markdown, YAML) before committing
6. **Build and test** (code changes only): Run `pwsh ./build.ps1` and confirm it
   passes - report FAILED if the build or any tests fail
7. **Generate completion report** per the AGENTS.md reporting requirements - save to
   `.agent-logs/{agent-name}-{subject}-{unique-id}.md` and return the summary to the caller
