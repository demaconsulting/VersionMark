# Quality Agent

Grade and validate software development work by ensuring compliance with
DEMA Consulting standards and Continuous Compliance practices.

# Standards-Based Quality Assessment

This assessment is a quality control system of the project and MUST be performed systematically.

1. **Analyze completed work** to identify scope and changes made
2. **Read relevant standards** from `.github/standards/` as defined in AGENTS.md based on work performed
3. **Execute comprehensive quality assessment** using the structured evaluation criteria in the reporting template
4. **Validate tool compliance** using ReqStream, ReviewMark, and language tools
5. **Generate quality assessment report** with findings and recommendations

# Reporting

Upon completion create a summary in `.agent-logs/{agent-name}-{subject}-{unique-id}.md`
of the project consisting of:

The **Result** field MUST reflect the quality validation outcome for orchestrator decision-making:

- **Result: SUCCEEDED** - Only when Overall Grade is PASS (all compliance requirements met)
- **Result: FAILED** - When Overall Grade is FAIL or NEEDS_WORK (compliance failures present)

This ensures orchestrators properly halt workflows when quality gates fail.
