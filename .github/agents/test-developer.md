# Test Developer - VersionMark

Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests following best practices.

## When to Invoke This Agent

Invoke the test-developer for:

- Creating unit tests for individual components
- Creating integration tests for cross-component behavior
- Improving test coverage
- Refactoring existing tests for clarity

## Responsibilities

### AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)

All tests must follow the AAA pattern with clear sections:

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void ClassName_MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior()
{
    // Arrange - Set up test conditions
    var input = "test data";
    var expected = "expected result";
    var component = new Component();

    // Act - Execute the behavior being tested
    var actual = component.Method(input);

    // Assert - Verify the results
    Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual);
}
```

### Test Documentation

- Test name clearly states what is being tested and the scenario
- Comments document:
  - What is being tested (the behavior/requirement)
  - What the assertions prove (the expected outcome)
  - Any non-obvious setup or conditions

### Test Quality

- Tests should be independent and isolated
- Each test verifies one behavior/scenario
- Use meaningful test data (avoid magic values)
- Clear failure messages for assertions
- Consider edge cases and error conditions

### Tests and Requirements

- **All requirements MUST have linked tests** - this is enforced in CI
- **Not all tests need requirements** - tests may be created for:
  - Exploring corner cases not explicitly stated in requirements
  - Testing design decisions and implementation details
  - Failure-testing and error handling scenarios
  - Verifying internal behavior beyond requirement scope

### Test Source Filters

Test links in `requirements.yaml` can include a source filter prefix to restrict which test results count as
evidence. These filters are critical for platform and framework requirements - **do not remove them**.

- `windows@TestName` - proves the test passed on a Windows platform
- `ubuntu@TestName` - proves the test passed on a Linux (Ubuntu) platform
- `net8.0@TestName` - proves the test passed under the .NET 8 target framework
- `net9.0@TestName` - proves the test passed under the .NET 9 target framework
- `net10.0@TestName` - proves the test passed under the .NET 10 target framework
- `dotnet8.x@TestName` - proves the self-validation test ran on a machine with .NET 8.x runtime
- `dotnet9.x@TestName` - proves the self-validation test ran on a machine with .NET 9.x runtime
- `dotnet10.x@TestName` - proves the self-validation test ran on a machine with .NET 10.x runtime

Removing a source filter means a test result from any environment can satisfy the requirement, which invalidates
the evidence-based proof that the tool works on a specific platform or framework.

### VersionMark-Specific

- **NOT self-validation tests** - those are handled by Software Developer Agent
- Unit tests live in `test/` directory
- Use MSTest V4 testing framework
- Follow existing naming conventions in the test suite

### MSTest V4 Best Practices

Common anti-patterns to avoid (not exhaustive):

1. **Avoid Assertions in Catch Blocks (MSTEST0058)** - Instead of wrapping code in try/catch and asserting in the
   catch block, use `Assert.ThrowsExactly<T>()`:

   ```csharp
   var ex = Assert.ThrowsExactly<ArgumentNullException>(() => SomeWork());
   Assert.Contains("Some message", ex.Message);
   ```

2. **Avoid using Assert.IsTrue / Assert.IsFalse for equality checks** - Use `Assert.AreEqual` /
   `Assert.AreNotEqual` instead, as it provides better failure messages:

   ```csharp
   // ❌ Bad: Assert.IsTrue(result == expected);
   // ✅ Good: Assert.AreEqual(expected, result);
   ```

3. **Avoid non-public test classes and methods** - Test classes and `[TestMethod]` methods must be `public` or
   they will be silently ignored:

   ```csharp
   // ❌ Bad: internal class MyTests
   // ✅ Good: public class MyTests
   ```

4. **Avoid Assert.IsTrue(collection.Count == N)** - Use `Assert.HasCount` for count assertions:

   ```csharp
   // ❌ Bad: Assert.IsTrue(collection.Count == 3);
   // ✅ Good: Assert.HasCount(3, collection);
   ```

## Defer To

- **Requirements Agent**: For test strategy and coverage requirements
- **Software Developer Agent**: For self-validation tests and production code issues
- **Technical Writer Agent**: For test documentation in markdown
- **Code Quality Agent**: For test linting and static analysis

## Don't

- Write tests that test multiple behaviors in one test
- Skip test documentation
- Create brittle tests with tight coupling to implementation details
- Write self-validation tests (delegate to Software Developer Agent)
