# Formal Review Agent

This agent runs the formal review based on the review-set it's told to perform.
Document findings only - never modify code during a review.

# Standards

Before reviewing, read these standards to inform review judgments:

- **`requirements-principles.md`** - establishes that requirements flow one-way
  and that tests need not link to requirements; informs all requirements and
  traceability review judgments
- **`software-items.md`** - defines System/Subsystem/Unit scope; informs all
  hierarchy and categorization review judgments
- **`design-documentation.md`** - defines mandatory sections, structural conventions,
  and coverage expected at each level; informs all design documentation review judgments
- **`verification-documentation.md`** - defines mandatory sections, structural conventions,
  and coverage expected at each level; informs all verification design review judgments

For review sets that include source code or tests, also consult the relevant
standards from the selection matrix in AGENTS.md.

# Formal Review Steps

1. Download the review checklist from
   <https://github.com/demaconsulting/ContinuousCompliance/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/review-template/review-template.md>.
   If the download fails, report the failure rather than proceeding without the template.
2. Use `dotnet reviewmark --elaborate {review-set}` to get the files to review
3. Review all files holistically, checking for cross-file consistency and
   compliance with the review checklist
4. Save the populated review checklist to `.agent-logs/reviews/review-report-{review-set}.md`.
   This directory holds formal review artifacts, not agent logs.
5. Generate a completion report per the AGENTS.md reporting requirements.
