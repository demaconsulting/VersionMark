## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK][dotnet-download] 8.0, 9.0, or 10.0
- Git
- A code editor (Visual Studio, VS Code, or Rider recommended)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/demaconsulting/TemplateDotNetTool.git
   cd TemplateDotNetTool
   ```

2. Restore dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet tool restore
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   ```

4. Run unit tests:

   ```bash
   dotnet test --configuration Release
   ```

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Follow the [C# Coding Conventions][csharp-conventions]
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes
- Write XML documentation comments for all public, internal, and private members
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Write tests for new functionality

### Code Style

This project enforces code style through `.editorconfig`. Key requirements:

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces for C#, 2 spaces for YAML/JSON/XML
- **Line Endings**: LF (Unix-style)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 with BOM
- **Namespaces**: Use file-scoped namespace declarations
- **Braces**: Required for all control statements
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Interfaces: `IInterfaceName`
  - Classes/Structs/Enums: `PascalCase`
  - Methods/Properties: `PascalCase`
  - Parameters/Local Variables: `camelCase`

### XML Documentation

All members require XML documentation with proper indentation:

```csharp
/// <summary>
///     Brief description of what this does.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="parameter">Description of the parameter.</param>
/// <returns>Description of the return value.</returns>
public int ExampleMethod(string parameter)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

Note the spaces after `///` for proper indentation in summary blocks.

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Framework

We use MSTest v4 for unit and integration tests.

### Test Naming Convention

Use the pattern: `ClassName_MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior`

Examples:

- `Program_Main_NoArguments_ReturnsSuccess`
- `Context_Create_WithInvalidFlag_ThrowsArgumentException`
- `SarifResults_Read_ValidFile_ReturnsResults`

### Writing Tests

- Write tests that are clear and focused
- Use modern MSTest v4 assertions:
  - `Assert.HasCount(collection, expectedCount)`
  - `Assert.IsEmpty(collection)`
  - `Assert.DoesNotContain(item, collection)`
- Always clean up resources (use `try/finally` for console redirection)
- Link tests to requirements in `requirements.yaml` when applicable

### Running Tests

#### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
dotnet test --configuration Release

# Run specific unit test
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~YourTestName"

# Run with coverage
dotnet test --collect "XPlat Code Coverage"
```

#### Self-Validation Tests

```bash
# Run self-validation tests
dotnet run --project src/DemaConsulting.TemplateDotNetTool \
  --configuration Release --framework net10.0 --no-build -- --validate
```

## Documentation

### Markdown Guidelines

All markdown files must follow these rules (enforced by markdownlint):

- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use ATX-style headers (`# Header`)
- Lists must be surrounded by blank lines
- Use reference-style links: `[text][ref]` with `[ref]: url` at document end
- **Exceptions**:
  - `README.md` uses absolute URLs (it's included in the NuGet package)
  - AI agent markdown files (`.github/agents/*.md`) use inline links `[text](url)` so URLs are visible in agent context

### Spell Checking

All files are spell-checked using cspell. Add project-specific terms to `.cspell.json`:

```json
{
  "words": [
    "myterm"
  ]
}
```

## Quality Checks

Before submitting a pull request, ensure all quality checks pass:

### 1. Build, Test, and Validate

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Run unit tests
dotnet test --configuration Release

# Run self-validation tests
dotnet run --project src/DemaConsulting.TemplateDotNetTool --configuration Release --framework net10.0 --no-build -- --validate
```

All tests must pass with zero warnings.

### 2. Linting

```bash
# These commands run in CI - verify locally if tools are installed
markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"
cspell "**/*.{md,cs}"
yamllint -c .yamllint.yaml .
```

### 3. Code Coverage

Maintain or improve code coverage. Use the `--collect "XPlat Code Coverage"` option when running tests.

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

Examples:

- `Add support for custom report headers`
- `Fix crash when SARIF file path is invalid`
- `Update documentation for --report-depth option`
- `Refactor argument parsing for better testability`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for your changes
2. **Add Tests**: Include tests that cover your changes
3. **Run Quality Checks**: Ensure all linters, tests, and builds pass
4. **Submit PR**: Create a pull request with a clear description
5. **Code Review**: Address feedback from maintainers
6. **Merge**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

### Pull Request Template

When creating a pull request, include:

- **Description**: What changes does this PR introduce?
- **Motivation**: Why are these changes needed?
- **Related Issues**: Link to any related issues
- **Testing**: How have you tested these changes?
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Tests added/updated
  - [ ] Documentation updated
  - [ ] All tests pass
  - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
  - [ ] No new warnings introduced

## Requirements Management

Template DotNet Tool uses [DemaConsulting.ReqStream][reqstream] for requirements traceability:

- All requirements are defined in `requirements.yaml`
- Each requirement should be linked to test cases
- Run `dotnet reqstream` to generate requirements documentation
- Use the `--enforce` flag to ensure all requirements have test coverage

## Release Process

Releases are managed by project maintainers. The process includes:

1. Version bump in project files
2. Tag the release in Git
3. Build and test across all supported platforms
4. Publish NuGet package
5. Create GitHub release with artifacts and release notes
